🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Calculator

This project is part of my coursework in the Machine Learning / AI Engineering Foundations Path on Codecademy.

It is an introductory Python project focused on applying basic Python syntax to a real-world example — calculating medical insurance costs based on patient data.

🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I built a simple Medical Insurance Cost Calculator using Python.

The project goals:

✅ Define variables to represent patient data
✅ Perform arithmetic calculations to compute insurance cost
✅ Output readable, formatted messages
✅ Practice Python fundamentals:
	•	Variables & data types
	•	Arithmetic operators
	•	String formatting
	•	Debugging and code structure

📂 Project Files
	•	Python Syntax Medical Insurance Project_Solution.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook containing the full solution.

🧠 What I Learned

✅ Improved understanding of Python syntax
✅ Practiced arithmetic and logical operations
✅ Strengthened skills in writing and debugging Python code
✅ Gained confidence using Jupyter Notebook to present code and outputs

🛠 How to Run
	1.	Clone this repository
	2.	Open the Python Syntax Medical Insurance Project_Solution.ipynb file in:
	•	Jupyter Notebook, or
	•	An IDE that supports .ipynb files (such as VS Code with the Jupyter extension)
	3.	Run each cell to follow the calculation steps.

🌟 Possible Extensions
	•	Refactor the cost calculation into a reusable function
	•	Add user input for patient data (using input() or interactive widgets)
	•	Handle multiple patients using data structures (lists, dictionaries)
	•	Implement validation checks (e.g. age ≥ 0, BMI ≥ 0)
	•	Visualize insurance costs across patients using simple plots
